# -Human-Activity-Recognition-
Human Activity Recognition Using LSTM (TensorFlow) This project implements a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using an LSTM-based recurrent neural network built with TensorFlow. The model is trained on segmented time-series sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) and classifies human activities such as walking, sitting, standing, etc.
